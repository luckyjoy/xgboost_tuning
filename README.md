# XGBoost Tuning
Using Python to construct and interpret an XGBoost classification model using the XGBoost modeling library.

**Build and Interpret an XGBoost Classification Model in Python**

In this activity, you'll construct and interpret an XGBoost classification model using the XGBoost library in Python. Key topics covered include:

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: Load required libraries for data processing and modeling.
2. **Model Fitting**: Train the XGBoost model on your dataset.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV**: Tune key hyperparameters using cross-validation:
   - `max_depth`
   - `min_child_weight`
   - `learning_rate`
   - `n_estimators`
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using precision, recall, and F1 score to measure its accuracy.
5. **Feature Importance**: Analyze the importance of features used in the model to identify key predictors.
